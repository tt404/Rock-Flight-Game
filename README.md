Ok for reference, this is how you send your updates.

1. Make your updates on eclipse and save it.
2. Go to the folder that has scroller-gdx and right click on an empty area -> Open with git bash
3. If done correctly git bash should open with the directory with (master) written at the end in cyan.
4. Now type in "git commit ."
5. Press the letter "i" on your keyboard to enter insert mode. 
6. Type out what you did on the first line. (if you mess up press ESC and press "u" to undo)
7. Press ESC to get out of insert mode then enter command mode by pressing SHIFT+; and type in "wq", then hit enter.
8. Now just do "git push" and it will send the changes to github after you enter your username and password.


This is how you get updates. I recommend doing this every time you start.
1. Go to the folder that has scroller-gdx and right click on an empty area -> Open with git bash
2. If done correctly git bash should open with the directory with (master) written at the end in cyan.
3. Do "git pull" and it should update.
